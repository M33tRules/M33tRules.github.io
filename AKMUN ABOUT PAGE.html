      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>The Model United Nations is an annual conference that brings together high school students from around the world to simulate the proceedings of the United Nations. The conference is designed to provide a platform for students to develop their critical thinking, public speaking, and problem-solving skills, while also gaining insight into the complexities of international relations.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our conference is open to all high school students who are interested in politics, diplomacy, and global affairs. We offer a variety of committees and events that allow participants to engage in meaningful discussions and debates on current issues such as climate change, economic development, human rights, and more.</p>
